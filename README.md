Class Version Checker
======================

A simple tool that will print out the [Java class file format major and minor number](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9170832/list-of-java-class-file-format-major-version-numbers).

This is required every now and then when you get a `java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError` and you actually don't know which library has the offending class file.

Either build the project and use the `class-version-checker.jar` from the `target` folder or download a build from the [releases tab](https://github.com/toomasr/class-version-checker/releases).
